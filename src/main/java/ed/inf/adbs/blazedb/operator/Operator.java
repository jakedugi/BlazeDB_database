 *   - Tuple Retrieval: Offering a method to fetch the next tuple from the operatorâ€™s stream.
 *   - State Reset: Enabling the operator to reinitialize its state for fresh iterations.
 *
 * All concrete operator implementations must implement {@link #getNextTuple()} and {@link #reset()}
 * to adhere to the iterator model.
